## Overview of the school district analysis
We have data from the school district with students' names, their math scores, reading scores, which schools they go to and, which district those schools are in, and etc. 
It's much of information and we are tring to clean up some of the areas in the data and figure out what the data is telling us; 
how different the math and reading scores are by school, how much money the schools are spending, how that is related to the students' scores and, 
which grade is doing better for each school. 

## Results

and the Overall Passing Percentage is 65.2%.

When you look at this screenshot above which is the updated district summary data frame, the percentages look different than the percentages from the original district summary.

% of Passing Math: 75.0% -> 74.8%
% of Passing Reading: 85.8% -> 85.7%
% of Passing Overall: 65.2% -> 64.9%

The percentages all went down, but not by much.
